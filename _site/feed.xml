        <title>ServiceNow Function for Checking an Email Whitelist Table</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;servicenow-function-for-checking-an-email-whitelist-table&quot;&gt;ServiceNow: Function for Checking an Email Whitelist Table&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I work now we accept incidents submitted via email from internal and external customers.
I recently had a requirement for a new assignment group that only wanted to accept incidents from a short list of domains.  Emails submitted to this group from other domains would not be processed into incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had an existing script include and inbound action to process incoming emails already, and an easy way to handle this would be with some if statements inside the inbound action.  However, this would not be easy to maintain or update if another group wanted a similar restriction down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I set up an email whitelist table with a reference field to the group table, a string field for the domain, and an active flag to turn off the rule if needed.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/email_whitelist.png&quot; alt=&quot;Email Whitelist table&quot; title=&quot;Email Whitelist table&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added a function to the existing script include to check this table.
If the assignment group has an active record (or multiple records), check the domains.  If there is a matching whitelist rule, allow the incident to be created.
If a record isn’t found, allow the incident creation as normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;```javascript
	checkWhitelist: function(assignment_grp, sender_domain) {
		// assignment_grp = reference to sys_user_group table
		// sender_domain = string
		// lookup whitelist table and if there is an active entry, apply it
		// if no entry returned, then allow any sender&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;	var gr = new GlideRecord('u_email_whitelist');
	gr.addQuery('u_group', assignment_grp);		
	gr.addQuery('u_active', true);  // if entry has been deactivated ignore it		
	gr.query();
	var grp_flag = false; // at least one active entry on whitelist table?
	var match_flag = false;  // matching domain for assignment group on whitelist?
	var i = 0;
	while (gr.next() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (!match_flag)) { // the group has at least one entry on the table but no match found yet
		i++;
		grp_flag = true;  // group entry on whitelist table
		if (gr.u_domain == sender_domain) {
			match_flag = true;  // sender allowed on whitelist
		}
		else {
			gs.log('checkWhitelist - no match for ' + gr.u_group.name + ' : ' + gr.u_domain);
			// sender not a match, keep looping through all matching records
		}		
	}
	if (grp_flag)   { // both entries good
		if (match_flag) {
			gs.log('checkWhitelist - match for ' + gr.u_group.name + ' and ' + gr.u_domain);
			return true; // there is a match and that's ok
		}
		return false; // there wasn't a match
	}
	else {
		return true; // there wasn't a match for the grp so it's ok to accept from any domain
	}		
},
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;```&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To whitelist new domains we only need to add another entry to the whitelist table.  The same goes for a new assignment group with a similar requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I Found Some of My Book Reviews from Last Century</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I read a lot of books when I was in college.  I wish I had kept better records and wrote more about what I liked about them, what I learned, how they made me feel, alas.
However, I did come across some notes in a bunch of old files that I have copied from old computer to new computer at least three times.
I can’‘t call these reviews but they are all I wrote at the time.  These were mostly library books (dead tree, not digital, denizens of the 21st century), so I have no Kindle highlights or annotations to look up.
If you want to remember something 20 years from now, write it down!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;neuromancer&quot;&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by William Gibson&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cyberpunk book that started it all.  Gibson’s 1984 version of the future
is anarchistic and gothic and exhilirating.  The AI issue receives treatment
as basically, if the AI’s smart enough to think, it’s smart enough to get
Out of Control (Kevin Kelly) and does just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;out-of-control&quot;&gt;Out of Control&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by Kevin Kelly&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A must-read book, even if all you read is the bibliography, which contains
tons of books that consider the issues of AI, Complexity, Science, etc.
Kevin Kelly asks a lot of good questions that still have me thinking.
Read it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;note: I did not read it again.  However, the issues he raised are now in our daily news feeds. -tgbates, 2016&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;count-zero----spoiler-alert&quot;&gt;Count Zero – SPOILER ALERT&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by William Gibson 
Is the 2nd book in the trilogy (I guess it’s
a trilogy).  Looks at the Projects in the future, has a neato little hacker
punk who dresses very hackishly, but doesn’t know what’s going on.  I liked
the Samurai more by the end than I did at first.  He finally decided he was
tired of getting shot up and settled down with his dead brother’s girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-difference-engine&quot;&gt;The Difference Engine&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling
  Book concerns England in the 1850’s and on to 1905.  Sybil Gerard, daughter
of Walter Gerard, who started a revolutionary movement but was killed, starts
off as the main character, a typical cyberpunk character.  She doesn’t know
much about the Engines or Kinotropes, but has a mentor in Mick Ralley, who
does.  Unfortunately, he is killed by a Texas Ranger sent out to kill Sam
Houston.
  Things switch to Edward Mallory, a scientist digging up dinosaur bones.
He shows the reader a scientist with integrity, who can kick butt, too.
He’s the most awesome scientist I’ve ever seen in a book.  Maybe that game
with the scientist fighting the space marines isn’t so far-out.  Of course,
Mallory has been in Wyoming with the savages, not in a lab.
  TDE covers topics similar to Out of Control.  The Science of Complexity is
covered.  Examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;p.183 Flocking is discussed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;p.211 The use of engines for simulations to observe how things work, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;p.223-224 Chaos theory explored&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;p.243-245 Vivid picture of London in anarchy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;p.302 View of history as progress opposed by the Catastrophe theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book, Inspector Ebenezer Fraser is an awesome guy, working in the
special services (your typical secret govt agency)
  There are some Japanese there, ready to reject their language in favor of
English so that they can be like the English.
  When the evil antagonist disrupts their sister’s wedding, Mallory and 2 of
his brothers, along with Fraser, decide to take matters into their own hands,
there being a general state of anarchy in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-hacker-crackdown&quot;&gt;The Hacker Crackdown:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by Bruce Sterling&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks at several sides of hacking, including law enforcement, hackers, and
civil liberties.  Makes me side with civil liberties when I think about
people busting in and taking my computer, disks, everything away and never
giving them back, never going to trial, anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-cuckoos-egg&quot;&gt;The Cuckoo’s Egg&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by Clifford Stoll&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His story of catching the cracker who broke in to many different computers
from Germany.  He calls him all kinds of nasty names, talks about how these
people are destroying the openness of the net, but also recounts how he
stole monitors and printers and everything else to try to catch the guy,
how he got the FBI and everybody worked up to do something about it instead
of handling it himself, etc.  Plus he was a hippy type, cozying up with the
feds.  Even his own friends would be worried about what he was doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-meaning-of-it-all--thoughts-of-a-citizen-scientist&quot;&gt;The Meaning Of It All:  Thoughts of a Citizen-Scientist&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by Richard P. Feynman&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short book consisting of 3 lectures he gave in 1963.  I’d say a must-read.
  Talks about how science is never certain.  If it is certain, then it is
prejudiced about new breakthroughs, etc.  A scientist can say, this is
probably what happens, but he isn’t 100% certain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;note: I had a note to finish this review but never did. -tgbates, 2016&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ServiceNow SNUG</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;norcal-snug&quot;&gt;NorCal SNUG&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I attended the &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.servicenow.com/events/2696&quot;&gt;NorCal SNUG at ServiceNow HQ in Santa Clara&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
When I was in Alabama I hadn’t attended any SNUGs in Birmingham, but this one was only a few miles from my new home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chuck-tomasi&quot;&gt;Chuck Tomasi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed getting a chance to chat with Chuck Tomasi about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/z2Ebuih3srw&quot;&gt;ServiceNow Live Coding Happy Hour&lt;/a&gt; and other videos.  I followed along with this one and got the Activate/Deactivate working.  Our users aren’t necessarily employees so we have to do deactivation differently than relying on LDAP refresh dates as a surefire indicator.  Using a script include means I can have these as buttons or call the deactivate methods from a script as well.
Later, during Chuck’s talk on ServiceNow as a Development Platform, I learned he had been driving all day to get there so I really appreciated that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;istanbul&quot;&gt;Istanbul&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got a sneak peek at Istanbul (not Constantinople), the next major release, which should be available before the end of the year.  Next year will be Jakarta, (not Jerusalem).  The CAB workbench looked useful as a way to replace the old multi-hour meetings I used to dial into.
I liked the automated agenda (the system at my previous company involved browsing for changes that were awaiting approval and could last 3 hours or more), and especially the idea of getting a notification when your time to speak is approaching!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;asset-life-cycle-management&quot;&gt;Asset Life Cycle Management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KPMG &amp;amp; Ebay presented their case study on asset life cycle management that included integration with SAP.  That would be a major challenge and it sounds like they devoted the resources necessary to tackle it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;organizational-change-management&quot;&gt;Organizational Change Management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We gathered in small group discussion to talk about our own experiences.  Incidents submitted via email still seems to be a challenge for everyone.
At my old company, we had incident creation via email disabled at Go-Live, cutting that off at the pass.  However, where I am now, we have to allow email incidents even from outside our domain, due to the nature of our business.  Incidents are about 10% spam as a result.  I implemented a business rule that might reduce it a little but am still waiting to see the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mobile-and-barcode&quot;&gt;Mobile and Barcode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learned about the new barcode field type and successfully tested it in my dev instance.  Now any mobile device can be used to scan barcodes directly into ServiceNow, great for asset management and saving the expense of those bulky scanners I used to deal with at my old company.  I set up a mobile page on my dev instance with a barcode field and scanned some of my books.  The next step will be to retrieve the title and author information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cancel-requested-item-ui-action&quot;&gt;Cancel Requested Item UI Action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve added a few more ServiceNow scripts to my snow repo, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tgbates/snow/blob/master/ui_actions/Cancel_Requested_Item.js&quot;&gt;Cancel Requested Item UI Action&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it was a great experience attending the SNUG, and I enjoyed getting to meet people and hear about how they are using ServiceNow.  And it included two meals!  Who says TANSTAAFL?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Upgrade from Linux Mint 17.1 MATE to 17.3</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;update&quot;&gt;Update&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I moved West to start a new job and during the chaos wasn’t updating my blog.&lt;br /&gt;
I’m getting settled in and have been learning a lot so I should be able to throw up some more content here.&lt;br /&gt;
I have also posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tgbates/snow&quot;&gt;a few more ServiceNow scripts in my snow repo.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-office&quot;&gt;New Office&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had my desktop packed up until I could set up an office at my new place.
After unpacking it, reinstalling my hard drives and plugging in my monitors, I couldn’t get them working right.
Either my primary monitor would work with the right resolution but the secondary wouldn’t display anything,
or the secondary would only be a clone of the primary, which was at such a low resolution it was one step above useless.
I also have to admit that at one point I thought I needed an adapter (was I secretly wishing for an excuse to make my first trip ever to a Fry’s?) when I really only needed my DVI cable which was tangled up with all my other cables.
And I also plugged in my DVI and HDMI into different video cards (my previous setting, if documented with a picture in Evernote before I packed for the move, wasn’t consulted).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;emptying-the-trash&quot;&gt;Emptying the Trash&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, I forgot to mention that I was doing some last-minute backups before the move and managed to fill up /dev/sda1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before worrying about the dual monitors I had to boot to a command prompt and clean out the trash.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=90&amp;amp;t=225222#p1187583&quot;&gt;I found a little tip on how to prevent that from happening again.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;black-screens-and-elephants&quot;&gt;Black Screens and Elephants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at my notes on the last time I had this situation back in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;   ctrl+alt+f1 to get to terminal &lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;   $ sudo service mdm stop &lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;   $ sudo X -configure &lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;   $ sudo service mdm start &lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This generated a new xorg.conf file that I could move to /etc/X11 but all it really accomplished for me was getting resolution right for 1 monitor and nothing for the secondary monitor.  After having two monitors, you can’t go back to only one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry for not having more screenshots but I wasn’t in a position to capture anything but text and will refrain from pasting huge blocks of output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this monitor process (I will skip recounting my dead ends playing with cvt, xrandr, get-edid | parse-edid, modelines, and editing xorg.conf), 
I had to blindly resort to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.howtogeek.com/119127/use-the-magic-sysrq-key-on-linux-to-fix-frozen-x-servers-cleanly-reboot-and-run-other-low-level-commands/&quot;&gt;Raising Elephants Is So Utterly (Obtuse/Boring) trick a few times.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;time-to-upgrade&quot;&gt;Time to Upgrade&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this point I had been flailing around for about 3 hours, so I decided it was time to try something else.
Upgrading to Mint 17.3 wasn’t really on the weekend agenda, but it did promise better multi-monitor support, so it was worth a shot.
I didn’t see how it could make things worse, and it was only a minor upgrade and was quick and painless.  This is why I installed Linux Mint in the first place!
It wasn’t a silver bullet, but at least it helped an aggravating problem I was having with windows missing their menu bars and spawning partially off my screen in the top left corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-the---force&quot;&gt;Use the –force&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that I thought updating my graphics drivers might help.
Another tip: If you use proprietary graphics drivers downloaded from AMD’s website and –force the installation you will break synaptic and have to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BAD IDEA&lt;/strong&gt;—&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;   $ sudo ./amd-driver-installer-14.20-x86.x86_64.run --force &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse than that, I broke X completely when I uninstalled fglrx from the command line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I saw the results of that I reinstalled it but by then it was time to leave for church and I didn’t have time to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…a couple hours later, I booted up and the monitors were detected (they had been “unknown” all this time in Mint) and I was able to set up resolutions, set primary/secondary, get my panel set up correctly, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fixing-synaptic&quot;&gt;Fixing Synaptic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synaptic couldn’t heal itself and Warned &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Uninstall : inst_path_default or inst_path_override does not exist in /etc/ati.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/20160815_monitorsb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;broken Synaptic&quot; title=&quot;broken synaptic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/fglrx-installer/+bug/565407&quot;&gt;I found a bug workaround posted that pointed a way to the solution.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-the---force-again-and-reinstall-the-amd-driver&quot;&gt;Use the –force again and Reinstall the AMD driver!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;   $ sudo ./amd-driver-installer-14.20-x86.x86_64.run --force &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;   $ sudo apt-get -f install &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;   restore of system environment completed &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Synaptic is working properly again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I should have been more patient.  Impatience could have led to reinstalling my hard drives incorrectly, along with the incorrect initial monitor setup. I’m fairly certain I took a picture of my cables before the move but didn’t take the time to look for it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I should have uninstalled fglrx properly before installing the AMD driver (without using the –force option, which the AMD installer recommended not using).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I didn’t always think before I acted when running commands.  This is only my personal computer, but it is still my most important personal computer, and a useful tool that I don’t want to break irreparably.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I ended up spending hours on this when maybe I could have only had to uninstall and reinstall fglrx if plugging the cables in right hadn’t prevented this from happening in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Tellico in Linux Mint 17.1 for Library Cataloguing</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;tellico-collection-manager&quot;&gt;Tellico collection manager&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been using &lt;a href=&quot;http://tellico-project.org/&quot;&gt;Tellico&lt;/a&gt; collection manager for several years, since my last machine, to keep track of my books.
I have somewhere north of 600 books (physical books) in my collection (not counting my wife’s collection).  Of that number, 200 are documented in tellico.  I had a lot of books before I started using Tellico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;one-of-my-favorite-features-in-tellico-is-the-isbn-search&quot;&gt;One of my favorite features in tellico is the ISBN search.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/tellico_isbn_search.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tellico ISBN Search&quot; title=&quot;Tellico ISBN Search&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For modern books with ISBN numbers you type the number (or scan the barcode).  You can enter multiple numbers in a batch also.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then you search that ISBN (Amazon is my preferred source–&lt;a href=&quot;http://tellico-project.org/adding-data-source&quot;&gt;requires an API key&lt;/a&gt; ) and can populate your record with the basic data for the book.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From there, you can add purchase date and price, genre and keywords, change the provided image, and add your own personal comments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;image-updating-tip&quot;&gt;Image updating tip&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the cover image to match mine in case I’m trying to find the book.  Usually you can find the matching edition on Amazon, but if not, snap a quick photo with your webcam and update your record with the new image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;book-organization&quot;&gt;Book organization&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Library cataloguing and organization is one of those time-intensive projects that never seems to be a top priority.&lt;br /&gt;
The problem with that is that you don’t know what you have.&lt;br /&gt;
Have you ever seen a book at a yard sale, library sale, on the clearance shelf, in the store or online and knew you wanted it but couldn’t remember if you already have a copy?&lt;br /&gt;
Yeah, that’s me, too.  I feel that if I can organize what I have, and be responsible with managing them, it is ok for me to acquire more books.  I don’t want to have them piled up on every flat surface in the house!
Part of that will include me building a sturdy bookshelf for my next fun woodworking project.
My rule now is anytime I pull a book off the shelf or rearrange it, to check Tellico.&lt;br /&gt;
If it’s not in there, add it right then.  I have been re-organizing my home office lately and that has included a little bit of book sorting.&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve even found it helpful to just get the books grouped into these general categories on the shelf, without alphabetizing by title or author or anything:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Christianity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;History&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Historical Fiction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Non-fiction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Physics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Computer Science/Technical&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Literature&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Science Fiction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fantasy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Westerns&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;General Fiction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finance &amp;amp; Investing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hobbies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I’ve found a couple of duplicates that I gave away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;online-catalog&quot;&gt;Online catalog&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured that if my catalog is posted online and I see a book I want to read, I will be able to check with my phone and make sure I don’t have the book already.  I will also start posting some book reviews, or at least thoughts on some of the books I’ve read.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Setting up a MIDI Keyboard in Linux Mint 17.1</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;setting-up-a-midi-keyboard&quot;&gt;Setting up a MIDI Keyboard&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought a MIDI Keyboard last year and this was the process to get it working.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://rafalcieslak.wordpress.com/2012/08/29/usb-midi-controllers-and-making-music-with-ubuntu/&quot;&gt;Rafal Cieslak's article&lt;/a&gt; was helpful in getting me running and understanding what I was doing.  I used another article for the setup but it is no longer online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;synaptic&quot;&gt;Synaptic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;install jack, jackd, qsynth and qjackctl&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;qsynth&quot;&gt;Qsynth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;click Setup -&amp;gt; Soundfonts -&amp;gt; Open and add the sf2 file in /usr/share/sounds/sf2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my install, it was TimGM6mb.sf2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click ‘Yes’ to restart the engine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/qsynth_setup01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;qsynth setup&quot; title=&quot;qsynth setup&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;plug-in-your-usb-midi-controller&quot;&gt;Plug in your USB midi controller&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;open-qjackctl&quot;&gt;Open Qjackctl&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;click Connect&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Select the ALSA tab, drag your midi controller to FluidSynth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/qjackctl_01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;qjackctl&quot; title=&quot;qjackctl&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;play-music&quot;&gt;Play Music!&lt;/h2&gt;

        <title>Getting Jekyll working in Linux Mint 17.1</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;getting-jekyll-working-in-linux-mint-171&quot;&gt;Getting Jekyll working in Linux Mint 17.1&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems like it should have been a straightforward process but I got lost along the way.
Here is my journey back onto the path of using jekyll for my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I was running into problems with missing zlib (which isn't missing) and ruby version too low for Jekyll 3, but Jekyll 2.5.3 works (or seemed to at first, details later))
&lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33503796/error-installing-jekyll-requires-ruby-2-0-0&quot;&gt;error-installing-jekyll-requires-ruby-2-0-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The below command seemed to work but turned out not to be too helpful later&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo gem install jekyll -v 2.5.3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;synaptic-packages-installed-to-obtain-a-working-httplocalhost4000&quot;&gt;synaptic packages installed to obtain a working http://localhost:4000&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;

Removed the following packages:

ruby2.0 (2.0.0.484-1ubuntu2.2)
rubygems-integration (1.5)

ruby2.0-dev (2.0.0.484-1ubuntu2.2)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;then-i-went-back-to-the-github-help&quot;&gt;Then I went back to the github help&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/&quot;&gt;Using jekyll with pages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo gem install bundler
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;made a Gemfile like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'github-pages'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;gave an error: public_suffix, ruby &amp;gt;= 2.0 required&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
An error occurred while installing public_suffix (1.5.3), and Bundler cannot
continue.
Make sure that `gem install public_suffix -v '1.5.3'` succeeds before bundling.
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;error-that-zlib-is-missing&quot;&gt;Error that zlib is missing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;lots of errors with &lt;code&gt;jekyll new&lt;/code&gt; command&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo gem install github-pages
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Error said zlib is missing, so try something else:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;let's try installing ruby-dev, ruby-dev-all, and rake&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and libxml2-ruby&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;more packages...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
rake (10.0.4-1)
ruby-all-dev (1:1.9.3.4)
ruby-dev (1:1.9.3.4)
ruby-libxml (2.7.0-2)
zlib1g-dev (1:1.2.8.dfsg-1ubuntu1)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo gem install github-pages
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
Successfully installed nokogiri-1.6.7.1
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;back-to-needing-ruby--20&quot;&gt;Back to needing Ruby &amp;gt;= 2.0&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Fetching: typhoeus-0.8.0.gem (100%)
Successfully installed typhoeus-0.8.0
ERROR:  Error installing github-pages:
	public_suffix requires Ruby version &amp;gt;= 2.0.
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30425210/nokogiri-failing-to-upgrade/31603202&quot;&gt;nokogiri failing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep running into this problem with not having ruby 2.0, even though I installed the package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rvm-installation&quot;&gt;rvm installation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;rvm looks like the solution to manage ruby versions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18541695/installed-ruby-using-apt-get-install-ruby-2-0-0-succeeded-but-not-using-correct&quot;&gt;rvm for setting default ruby version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(make sure synaptic is not running before attempting to run the installation of rvm)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
  $ \curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
$ rvm rubies

=* ruby-2.2.1 [ x86_64 ]

# =&amp;gt; - current
# =* - current &amp;amp;&amp;amp; default
#  * - default


$ ruby -v
ruby 2.2.1p85 (2015-02-26 revision 49769) [x86_64-linux]
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;another advantage, now I don't have to sudo install gems&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
$ gem install jekyll --no-rdoc --no-ri

...

Successfully installed jekyll-3.0.1
14 gems installed
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
$ jekyll new myblog
New jekyll site installed in myblog. 
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ran the following and was able to view it at &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000&quot;&gt;http://localhost:4000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
$ jekyll serve
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
...

&lt;/pre&gt;

        <title>Welcome to Jekyll!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Tom&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &amp;#39;Hi, Tom&amp;#39; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home&quot;&gt;Jekyll docs&lt;/a&gt; for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll’s GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;. If you have questions, you can ask them on &lt;a href=&quot;https://talk.jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll Talk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
