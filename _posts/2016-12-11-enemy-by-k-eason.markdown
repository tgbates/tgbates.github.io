# Enemy, by K. Eason, read in May-June 2016 timeframe

This was available free on Amazon under the Kindle First program.  As part of moving, I used mass 
transit for a time.  This involved 3-4 hours per day.  In the Bay Area, daily commutes 
of 4 hours by car are not unusual.  Between switching from various modes of transport,
I might get 30 minutes or so of uninterrupted time to read.  I found light reading was
best for this.  A book that compelled note-taking or annotating or looking up terms
was not a good candidate for me to plow through during this time.  I could do a chapter
maybe but then would want some time to digest and ponder what I had read, instead of just going
straight into the next chapter.  

Anyway, _Enemy_ was a good candidate for reading during the ride to work.  It apparently was
the first book in the series, and was given away for free on Amazon Kindle to encourage readership in
the entire series.  

Some notes on _Enemy_.  It was set in a fantasy world, in a style reminiscent of Glen Cook's
_Black Company_ series, with gritty realism in the action and dialogue.  Magic and the gods
play a strong part, but this is not a formulaic Joseph Campbell monomyth hero story.
A couple of the main characters are outsiders from their culture.
The heroine, Snowdenaelikk ("Snow" for short, thankfully) seems derivative of a Forgotten Realms half-Drow, although I encountered no trademarked terms that anyone could be sued for using, in case any Wizards lawyers are reading this.  Does Wizards still own D&D?  I resisted the urge to look it up and continued working
on this review.  Veiko, the hero, is like an Inuit, who is also an outcast from his people.  They are both compelling adult characters.

To me part of the fun of fantasy is learning about this alien world, so I enjoy strange terms,
names, places, etc.  _Enemy_ had these in a proper dose for me to keep me questioning and interested.

I am writing months later, but recall feeling that there were some subtle allegorical elements.  These were well-handled, I didn't feel I was being beaten over the head with them or that it disrupted my enjoyment of the story.  Maybe it instead helped me see the plight of these outsiders from a different viewpoint.  
I think alienation is a part of the human condition that is common to everyone at some point or another.  At certain times and places, I feel like I am the outsider, and
at other times and places, I am the "us" against the "them", doing to others what I would not want done to me.

Eason does well in depicting this world, with vivid sensory details of how it looks,
smells, etc.  It was great to escape into this world while commuting.  I could see it
portrayed in an anime.  I eagerly flipped the pages on my Kindle app to find out what would
happen to the characters next.  

In summary, this book was good but nothing in it compelled me to
read the next in the series.  I will say something on why I generally don't read Fantasy series
here (endless series seem to be the norm in Fantasy (following Tolkien) and Mystery (following Holmes).)

I read some good advice from Gene Wolfe years ago for those who wanted to be writers.
Don't read endless series.  And I've followed it pretty well.  I mean, I didn't even
read the next book after finishing Frank Herbert's _Dune_, and that book to me was
mind-expanding at the time I read it in an intense way that is hard to replicate now
that I'm older.  I was afraid of being let down if I continued the series.  Generally the
best effort by the creator of the series is at the beginning and it deteriorates as it goes.  A friend
whose judgement I trusted in fiction was telling me about crazy things in the series
and I didn't feel like continuing down that path.  I hadn't heard of Gene Wolfe at the
time, but that is probably why I considered his advice to be good; I was already following
this rule on my own.  Which is probably the best advice, someone telling you to do
something that you know is right and maybe just giving you the validation you needed
to keep doing it.

And now I hear that among all the other craziness of 2016, that J.K. Rowling wrote
another Harry Potter book?  Is this true, or is it "fake news" like the clickbait 
that most news websites scatter all around any of their presumably legitimate articles?  What happened, did a lot of people write and say they 
would kill themselves if she didn't write another one?  That last book was such 
torture for me, twice as long as it needed to be, each book longer than the one
before it, and pointlessly so with the case of the last one, it spoiled all the
magic I had felt on first beginning the series.  I understand that some people run
marathons so they can say they accomplished it, and I can see the justification, it
_is_ an accomplishment.  However, reading a series of books to completion is nowhere
near the level of accomplishment.  Yes, it is time-consuming, but if there are 
moments in reading for entertainment where you have the same feeling as someone
who is about to puke from running, then maybe you should quit reading the book.
There won't be a quiz on it!  Only binge-watching a TV show on Netflix is a lower
level of achievement.  Wait?  Are there trophies for this stuff?  If so, I'm missing
out.  

So, you've completed your "marathon" of reading, and now you have to read to completion again when the final, final book comes out!  I mean, I finished the 
marathon of Harry Potter and now you tell me I have to run another 10 miles!  Not
gonna happen.  I don't even think I watched all the movies.  (Same for Star Wars
prequels and postquels, btw.)

So, I am probably done with _Bones of Gods_.  I also didn't continue _The Malazan Book of the Fallen_
after reading _Gardens of the Moon_, so no knock on Eason's _Enemy_.  I apologize for interrupting
my review with a rant on endless series.  I will not even get started on _Song of Ice and Fire_.
I suppose it is like buying art; wait until the painter is dead, then you know what possibilities
you are dealing with before you get started.  Oh wait, now series are completed or even resurrected after the
author is dead.  As the spiritualist told Houdini in the TV miniseries, "When you are dead we can make you say whatever we want."
That is a topic for another day.
