# Adding Disqus Comments Capability
I looked at some different methods for supporting comments without resorting to Disqus but one only worked for commenters with a github account.  Another required a script on the server.
I do not know how many potential commenters are out there so I did not want to spend a lot of time on adding comments; Disqus was a solution that did not require a big time commitment.  
If you do not want to use disqus but want to comment, you are free to contact me some other way.  My email, github, and twitter handles are below.
