# Books I Read in 2016

This was a year of great change for me, what with moving across country to start a
new job.  As if that wasn't enough change, I also went from the business world to
academia, so almost everything is different between the two.  One similarity between this job and the old, is that I have two weeks off for
Christmas.  
I hope to spend some of the time before Christmas reflecting on the year gone by.  Part of that involves writing brief reviews of the books I have
read this year.  I know from experience that if I don't write something when it is
still relatively fresh in my mind, I will forget what the book was about or what
impressions it gave me.
